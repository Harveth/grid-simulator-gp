# Grid Simulator

## How to run

Run the following files in order:

1. `python main.py`
2. `python sim.py`
3. `python meters.py`

Or run `python start_all.py` to run all three files in order. Increase `SLEEP_TIME` in `start_all.py` to make sure the previous file has finished initializing before the next one starts.
